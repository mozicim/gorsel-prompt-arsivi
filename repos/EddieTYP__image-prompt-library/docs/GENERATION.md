# Local Generation Guide

Local installs can optionally connect **ChatGPT / Codex OAuth** for image generation. The GitHub Pages Online Read Only Demo stays read-only and does not expose generation or mutation controls.

## What the local generation flow does

Once connected, you can:

- Generate a new image from a fresh prompt.
- Queue a `Generation set` of 3, 5, or 10 independent variations from the same prompt and settings.
- Generate a variant from an existing reference.
- Review generated results before saving them into the library.
- Attach a result to its unchanged source item when available.
- Save a result as a new item with editable metadata.
- Keep useful generation details such as provider, model, original item, and batch position.
- Use prompt variables such as `{{subject}}`, `{{style}}`, or `{{主體}}` in reusable template prompts and fill them before each generation.

No OpenAI API key is required by the app for the ChatGPT / Codex OAuth path. Advanced provider configuration is available for users who need it, but the normal flow is handled from the Config drawer.

## Privacy boundary

Generation is local-install only. The public GitHub Pages demo does not perform live imports or generation and does not expose Add/Edit/private-library controls.

The app-owned OAuth store and local provider config must resolve outside the active library. If `IMAGE_PROMPT_LIBRARY_AUTH_PATH` or `IMAGE_PROMPT_LIBRARY_CONFIG_PATH` resolves to the library itself or any child path, startup stops before the database or credential files are read. Library-managed media roots (`originals`, `thumbs`, `previews`, `generation-results`, and `generation-references`) must also resolve inside the library; external symlink or junction targets are rejected so they cannot alias app-owned state. The app does not move or delete an unsafe file automatically.

For an existing unsafe override, move the file manually to `~/.image-prompt-library/auth.json` or `~/.image-prompt-library/config.json`, update or unset the override, then restart. Treat any older backup that may contain the file as sensitive; reconnect the provider if the credential may have been exposed. Tokens must never be committed to git, sample bundles, backups, or GitHub Pages exports.

## Connect the provider

Open **Config → Providers**, then choose **Connect** under **ChatGPT / Codex OAuth**. Follow the authorization link, enter the one-time code, approve the request, then return to Image Prompt Library and choose **Check authorization**.

The browser may label the request **Codex CLI**. Only approve a flow you started from your local Image Prompt Library app. When setup is complete, the provider shows **Connected**.

## Generate and review results

Open **Create image**, enter a prompt, and choose settings. **Generate** creates one result; the adjacent menu creates 3, 5, or 10. Each result uses a separate generation request. Template prompts can include `{{variables}}`; the composer previews the resolved prompt before sending.

Review completed results from the **Work queue**. For each result, choose **Save as new item**, **Use result as edit input**, **Retry**, or **Discard**. **Attach to current item** is also available when the result came from an unchanged saved reference. **Use as draft** copies the result's prompt and reusable settings back into the composer. Batch review keeps each result's position and advances to the next unfinished result. Using a result as a draft or edit input pauses review; **Continue review** returns to the remaining results.

Queued and running jobs remain in the Work queue if you close or refresh the page. Deleting a source reference does not cancel them; completed detached results can still be saved as new items.

Before saving a result as a new reference, edit its details. The read-only generation record shows the provider, model, batch position, and original item when available. Internal identifiers are not displayed.

## When generation fails

The app gives a short next step for each failure:

- If the prompt is blocked, edit it and generate again.
- If the provider rate-limits requests, the failed result stays available for manual retry while untouched queued jobs wait.
- If the provider is unavailable, retry shortly; the prompt and references stay with the job.
- If authorization is required, open **Config → Providers**, reconnect, then retry.
- For other failures, retry the result or edit the prompt first.

The composer can show the sanitized provider error under **Provider details** as secondary diagnostic text. The queue intentionally shows only the classified guidance. Neither surface displays credentials or unsanitized provider responses.

## Current provider notes

The local queue has no artificial submission cap and runs up to five generation jobs at once. Additional jobs wait in the Work queue.

If the provider reports a rate limit, the app pauses that provider's queue before continuing untouched queued jobs. The failed result stays failed until you retry it. Normal OAuth renewal happens in the background; reconnect only when the app says authorization is required.
